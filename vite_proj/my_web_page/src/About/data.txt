I am a passionate learner and problem solver and enjoy making the most of my skillset.
Currently improving my full-stack skills, I hope to adopt a wider variety of technology
as I grow. Besides university, I have worked on multiple projects and expanded my
knowledge-base to have a solid grasp of programming and project-designing.
I love collaborating with intelligent people and having meaningful, productive
conversations that help me grow alongside everyone around me.
